description = "An exploration research to formally define the metrics of character-level perturbations that may impact the performance of mainstream large language models (LLMs), and an empirical study of the character-level robustness of LLMs. A tool named PdD is proposed and open-sourced by us. This work is a collaboration with the University of Queensland."
