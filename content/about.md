# Whether to sort pages by "date", "weight", or "none". More on that below

# Used by the parent section to order its subsections.
# Lower values have priority.

# Template to use to render this section page
# template = "section.html"

# Apply the given template to ALL pages below the section, recursively.
# If you have several nested sections each with a page_template set, the page
# will always use the closest to itself.
# However, a page own `template` variable will always have priority.
# Not set by default
# page_template =

# How many pages to be displayed per paginated page.
# No pagination will happen if this isn't set or if the value is 0
# paginate_by = 0

# If set, will be the path used by paginated page and the page number will be appended after it.
# For example the default would be page/1
# paginate_path = "page"

# Whether to insert a link for each header like the ones you can see in this site if you hover one
# The default template can be overridden by creating a `anchor-link.html` in the `templates` directory
# Options are "left", "right" and "none"
# insert_anchor_links = "none"

# Whether the section pages should be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to true in the config
# in_search_index = true

# Whether to render that section homepage or not.
# Useful when the section is only there to organize things but is not meant
# to be used directly
render = true

# Whether to redirect when landing on that section. Defaults to not being set.
# Useful for the same reason as `render` but when you don't want a 404 when
# landing on the root section page.
# Example: redirect_to = "documentation/content/overview"
redirect_to = ""

# Whether the section should pass its pages on to the parent section. Defaults to `false`.
# Useful when the section shouldn't split up the parent section, like
# sections for each year under a posts section.

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), Germany. My research is affiliated with the Chair of Software Engineering & AI at the Heilbronn campus. My research interests include software engineering, trustworthy AI, and AI for society. I obtained my PhD degree at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), under the joint supervision of Professor Dong Jin Song at NUS and Dr. Teo Sin Gee at Infocomm Research (I2R), Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A\*STAR). 

Previously I served as a Research Scientist at I2R, A\*STAR in Singapore, a Software Analyst at NCS (a member of the SingTel Group), and a Software Engineer at Gemalto (now part of Thales Group). Prior to my research career, I worked in diverse product teams such as CAD software development, mobile banking solutions, and e-government platform. My previous research covers security analysis on mobile applications and blockchain. I received my Bachelor (Hons.) of Engineering degree in Computer Science at the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, and my Master of Computing degree in Infocomm Security at the School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

#### Perspective students

I am open to supervise thesis project for bachelor and master students within TUM (available for Winter semester 2025 and onwards). The project topics includes but not limited to:

* Security of Large Language Models and their applications
* Privacy Preservation & Compliance of Large Language Models
* Security & Privacy Assessment of Mobile Apps & Systems
* Understanding Deployment Tools for LLMs in Real-World Applications

Interested applicant can directly write to [application(at)seai.cit.tum.de](mailto:application@seai.cit.tum.de). Instructions and more details about the thesis opportunities within the chair of SE & AI can be found [here](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/seai/open-theses/).
