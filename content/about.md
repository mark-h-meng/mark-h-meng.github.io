# Apply the given template to ALL pages below the section, recursively.
# If you have several nested sections each with a page_template set, the page
# will always use the closest to itself.
# However, a page own `template` variable will always have priority.

# No pagination will happen if this isn't set or if the value is 0

# If set, will be the path used by paginated page and the page number will be appended after it.
# For example the default would be page/1
# paginate_path = "page"

# Whether to insert a link for each header like the ones you can see in this site if you hover one
# The default template can be overridden by creating a `anchor-link.html` in the `templates` directory
# Options are "left", "right" and "none"

# Whether the section pages should be in the search index. This is only used if
# `build_search_index` is set to true in the config

# Whether to render that section homepage or not.
# Useful when the section is only there to organize things but is not meant
# to be used directly

# Whether to redirect when landing on that section. Defaults to not being set.
# Useful for the same reason as `render` but when you don't want a 404 when
# landing on the root section page.
# Example: redirect_to = "documentation/content/overview"

# Whether the section should pass its pages on to the parent section. Defaults to `false`.
# Useful when the section shouldn't split up the parent section, like
# sections for each year under a posts section.

I am a PhD candidate at School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS), under the joint supervision of Professor Dong Jin Song at NUS and Dr. Teo Sin Gee at Institute for Infocomm Research (I2R), A\*STAR. I work closely with A/Prof. Bai Guangdong's team at the University of Queensland. My research interests include cyber-security and software engineering. 

Previously I severed as a Software Engineer at Gemalto (now part of Thales Group), a Software Analyst at NCS (a member of the SingTel Group) and a Research Engineer at Institute for Infocomm Research, A\*STAR. I received my Bachelor (Hons.) of Engineering degree in Computer Science at School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University (NTU), Singapore, and Master of Computing degree in Infocomm Security at School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

Prior to joining NUS for the PhD study, I have worked in diverse product teams such as CAD software development, mobile banking solutions and e-government platform. My previous research covers security analysis on mobile applications and blockchain.
